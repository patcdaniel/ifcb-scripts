## Processing With Python

On 'concave.shore.mbari.org' I downloaded the .hdr, .roi and .asi files from the SC Wharf from a random day.

```
curl -O http://128.114.25.154:8888/IFCB104/D20210629T161913_IFCB104.hdr
curl -O http://128.114.25.154:8888/IFCB104/D20210629T161913_IFCB104.roi
curl -O http://128.114.25.154:8888/IFCB104/D20210629T161913_IFCB104.adc
```
